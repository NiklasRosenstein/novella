# novella

Novella is a build system for processing files in a temporary directory isolated from the project source code. It is
designed for the preprocessing of documentation source code such as Markdown files before they are passed into a
static site generator such as [Mkdocs][] or [Hugo][]. Novella was designed as the backbone for [Pydoc-Markdown][],
but can be used independently.

  [Mkdocs]: https://www.mkdocs.org/
  [Hugo]: https://gohugo.io/
  [Pydoc-Markdown]: https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown
  [Novella Documentation]: https://niklasrosenstein.github.io/novella

Check out the [Novella Documentation][] for more information.

> Note: Novella is currently a work in progress project and is considered unstable.
