# novella

Novella is a linear build system for content processing in a temporary directory isolated from the project source
code. It is designed for the preprocessing of documentation source code such as Markdown files before they are
passed into a static site generator such as [Mkdocs][] or [Hugo][]. Novella in itself does not provide any tool or
domain specific logic, but serves as a framework that [Pydoc-Markdown][] plugs into.

  [Mkdocs]: https://www.mkdocs.org/
  [Hugo]: https://gohugo.io/
  [Pydoc-Markdown]: https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown
  [Novella Documentation]: niklasrosenstein.github.io/novella
